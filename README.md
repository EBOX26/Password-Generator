# Password-Generator
A password generator made using JavaScript

This is a password generator made as a third week challenge.
In this challenge I was given starter code that had completed HTML and CSS, with the goal of completing the JavaScript file myself. 
This password generator will (when generate password button is clicked) display a series of prompts for the user to answer.
First it will ask how many characters the user would like in the passsword being between 8 - 128. If outside of that parameter an alert will be prompted. 
Then prompts asking if user would like numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. 
If none of these prompts are chosesn then an alert will be prompted and then looped back through the prompts. 
After all parameters have been chosen then the password generator will make a password displaying it on the page. 
The JavaScript file has been pseudocoded and commented through my thought process
